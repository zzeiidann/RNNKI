Not mutinous in peace, yet bold in war,
Till your strong hand shall help to give him strength
Which his aspiring rider seem'd to know,
To Lydia and to Ionia, Whilst--
Your noble friends do lack you.
I know my lord hath spent of Timon's wealth,
For death remember'd should be like a mirror,
Sword, pike, knife, gun, or need of any engine,
That I profess myself in banqueting
And I am going to deliver them.
